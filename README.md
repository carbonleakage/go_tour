# Learning Go

This repo contains all the Go code I wrote while following different resources.

## Resources used

1. I started learning Go by retyping the code in the [golang tour](https://go.dev/tour/),
and solving the exercises locally. The code is within the [go_tour](go_tour) folder.
2. [Exercism go track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) is in the
   [go_exercism](go_exercism) folder
